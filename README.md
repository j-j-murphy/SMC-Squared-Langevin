# HESS-MC2: SEQUENTIAL MONTE CARLO SQUARED USING HESSIAN INFORMATION AND SECOND ORDER PROPOSALS

## Models
```target_pf.py``` provides a general-purpose ```logpdf``` method to return the log posterior $\pi(\theta)$, gradient of the log posterior $\nabla\pi(\theta)$ and Hessian of the log posterior $\nabla^2\pi(\theta)$. Particle filters such as ```sir_PF``` in ```sir.py``` inherit from this object while specifying the dynamics and weight update in a ```run_particleFilter()``` method which returns the loglikelihood $p(\mathbf{y}_{1:t}|\theta)$

## Running Parameter Estimation 
Parameter estimation can be performed by running for example ```SMC.sh param_est_sir.py``` on systems with the SLURM workload manager. On individual workstations you can run ```mpiexec -n $number_of_cores python param_est_sir.py``` 

## Results Generation
Results are generated using '''plotting.py``` and ```boxplots.py```


## Requirements
To install required packages run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
